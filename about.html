			A Dallas hot spot for those who are constantly on-the-go, The Juice Bar is<br> known for its healthy creations that don’t sacrifice on flavor. The Juice Bar is<br> locally owned and operated, specializing in chef-created pressed juices, <br>smoothies and bowls. With a focus on quality ingredients and unique flavors,<br> The Juice Bar serves up nothing but the best.</p>

Founders Tom Hennings and Heidi Lane have devoted their careers to channeling<br> their passion for food and its’ effects on health and wellness. After graduating from SMU, Hennings spent the<br> next 25 years working in operations for a variety of quick service and fast casual concepts. Lane’s background as a chef, caterer,<br> television producer of The Rosie O’Donnell Show (where she won an Emmy) and many other ventures, eventually led her to join forces with Hennings to open their first Juice Bar location in 2012. Hennings knew that Lane’s forte was developing recipes, <br>so the two partnered together and went on to develop a robust menu offering that was not just healthy but also convenient and<br> really good. Lane explains, “I’m a chef, and he’s a restaurant guy, so the combination of our experience made sense.</b></font></center>
